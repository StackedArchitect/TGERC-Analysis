## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This comprehensive analysis examined the relationship between weather parameters and electricity consumption in Telangana from 2020 to 2024. The study reveals significant correlations that can inform tariff design and demand management strategies.

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Temperature Impact
- **Correlation Coefficient**: 0.861 (Strong positive correlation)
- **Consumption Sensitivity**: Approximately 283.0 MU increase per °C
- **Threshold Temperature**: Significant consumption increase above 28°C

### 2. Seasonal Variations
- **Peak Season**: April-May (Summer)
- **Summer vs Winter**: 39.1% higher consumption in summer
- **Monsoon Effect**: 5032 MU average during monsoon

### 3. Weather Parameters Ranking (by correlation with consumption)
1. Average Temperature: 0.861
2. Heat Index: 0.192
3. Cooling Degree Days: 0.866
4. Humidity: -0.316
5. Rainfall: 0.061

### 4. Predictive Modeling Results
- **Best Model**: Ridge Regression
- **R² Score**: 0.410
- **RMSE**: 654.5 MU
- **MAE**: 622.4 MU

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TGERC

### 1. Seasonal Tariff Structure
- Implement **summer surcharge** of 15-20% during April-June
- Consider **time-of-day pricing** with peak hours extended in summer
- Introduce **weather-responsive tariffs** linked to temperature forecasts

### 2. Demand Management
- **Pre-summer campaigns** to promote energy efficiency before peak season
- **Incentive programs** for efficient cooling systems
- **Load shifting initiatives** during extreme temperature days

### 3. Infrastructure Planning
- **Capacity augmentation** targeting 6529 MU by 2025
- **Grid reinforcement** in urban areas with high cooling demand
- **Renewable integration** to match solar peak with cooling demand

### 4. Consumer Communication
- **Weather alerts** linked to expected consumption patterns
- **Mobile apps** showing real-time tariffs based on weather
- **Educational programs** on weather-consumption relationships

### 5. Regulatory Framework
- **Dynamic tariff mechanisms** responding to weather conditions
- **Performance incentives** for utilities managing weather-driven peaks
- **Data-driven planning** using weather forecasts for grid operations

## METHODOLOGY

The analysis employed:
- Statistical correlation analysis
- Multiple regression modeling
- Time series decomposition
- Machine learning algorithms
- Scenario-based forecasting

## FUTURE RESEARCH

1. District-wise analysis for localized tariff design
2. Real-time weather integration for dynamic pricing
3. Climate change impact assessment on long-term demand
4. Consumer behavior analysis during extreme weather events
